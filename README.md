## 🧠 How It Works

1. You will be asked to enter:
   - `0` for **Rock**
   - `1` for **Paper**
   - `2` for **Scissors**
2. The computer will randomly choose one of the three.
3. The winner is decided based on the classic rules:
   - Rock 🪨 beats Scissors ✂️  
   - Paper 📄 beats Rock 🪨  
   - Scissors ✂️ beats Paper 📄
4. You can choose to play again or exit the game anytime.
